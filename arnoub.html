<h1>My Kitty: Arnoub</h1>
<p>
    Arnoub was born on June 2017. He was found with his brothers and sisters in the streets. 
    He lived with his brothers until he was five months old. 
    Arnoub came to our house for the first time the week before Chrismas 2017. 
    He was the best gift I could ever ask for. Arnoub quickly got used to us and we became a family.

<h2>A day in the life of Arnoub</h2>
<p>
    Arnoub starts his day by trying to waking me up. Either by eating my hair or biting my toes. 
    Then, he has his breakfast, one of the two meals he has per day. He plays a bit in the morning. 
    Then spend most of his day by the window watching birds and children playing in park. 
    When I come home from work, he greets me with kisses. After that, he has his dinner.
